Man, how are you handling with this meteor business?
It's crazy stuff, can you believe it?
I think it's all a joke just to scare us...
But what if it's not? Shouldn't we do something?
For me the best way to cope is drinking...
Maybe we should ask the witch for help.
That evil woman... I'm glad she went away.
We don't even know where she lives now!
I bet she's only interested in saving herself.
Maybe she left something useful behind in her old house.
