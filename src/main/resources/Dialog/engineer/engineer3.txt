Hmm... Well...
I have some ideas for a contraption, but I can't seem to find the necessary tools.
I'm hoping you can help me with that.
Let's get started. The first item in my list...
How can I describe it?
It has bristles but it's not a toothbrush,
It has a handle but It's not a door,
It can be used in the kitchen but it's not a microwave,
It can be sat on but it's not a chair
It's used by witches but it's not a cauldron.
You think you got it?

Yes, I'm on my way to find it
Don't think so, can you repeat?
