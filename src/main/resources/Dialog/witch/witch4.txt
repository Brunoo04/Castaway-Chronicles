You're lucky I need someone's help, I don't like sharing my ideas.
Have you heard about the legend of the pirates on this Island?
Once upon a time, when pirates ruled the world...
This Island was unreachable by sea, so they had to find a way to get here.
The Captain Jackwik Sparrow asked my fellow witches for help.
And they came up with a flying boat which had amazing powers.
However, the boat lost its magic and ever since the pirates died, no one could find it.
I think I've found a way to make it fly again.
I'm just having some trouble discovering where it is.
But I have some clues...
Take a look at this parchment they left behind.
