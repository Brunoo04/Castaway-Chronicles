That's a question I wish I knew the answer to...
She was a great friend of mine, also a lover of pirates.
It made me very sad to see the way she was treated here.
Hope she's happier now...
I'm rambling sorry, unfortunately, I can't help you with that.
Her whereabouts are a mystery to me, but good luck!
